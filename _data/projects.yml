- name: Project 1 - TunnelMan
  num: 1
  descr: "This project is a fully functional game modeled after the classic arcade game 'Dig Dug'. Dig your way through the mines in order to find the hidden oil before the angry protesters catch you. You can use tools such as sonar, gold nuggets, and water guns to help protect yourself. Just watch out for fallling rocks. <br> "

- name: Project 3 - UAV Optimization Script
  num: 3
  descr: "This MATLAB project computes the lift, drag, power required, propeller efficiency, cruising speed, stall speed, stability margins, range, and endurance of a small UAV with a given payload. The script then creates N=100,000 aircraft with randomized geometries such as wing area, wingspan, chord lengths, and fuselage lengths in order to identify the optimal dimensions for maximum endurance. Finally, the code outputs the specs of the best identified aircraft, along with a generated preliminary 3D model."

- name: Project 4 - Thermal Image Indexing Code 
  num: 4
  descr: "This MATLAB script takes in RGB thermal images from an infrared camera and analyzes the data to trigger a response if the observed region's temperature exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, this project can store the data to identify the point in time when the observation region was hottest."

- name: Engine Turbine Modal and Deflection Analysis - Abaqus
  descr: In this project I modeled an engine turbine and determined the maximum deflections of the blades in the relevant range of RPM. Additionally, I found the vibrational modes of the engine and created a Campbell diagram in MATLAB to highlight the frequencies to dampen at operating RPM.

- name: UAV Design - CAD
  descr: This Solidworks project was completed in tandem with the UAV optimization script described above. Once the optimization code gave me the optimal dimensions, I modeled the plane in Solidworks using the appropriate airfoils, cross sections, and wing sweeps.
